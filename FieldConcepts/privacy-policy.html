        <h3> Privacy Policy </h3>
        <p>
            Transparency is key in regards to privacy.  FieldConcepts does not do anything with your data.  You will NEVER be prompted by the app to input any personal information.  Additionally, FieldConcepts does not make use of any personal device data.
            <br><br>
            FieldConcepts does not track any analytics events, nor does it send any logs or reports to a third party system.  Furthermore, it does not display any advertisements.  The app is intended to be a tool that relies on your creativity, not your data.  This is why we don’t track any actions.
        </p>

        <h3> What Information Does FieldConcepts Collect? </h3>
        <p>
            FieldConcepts does not collect any information.  It does not prompt, store, or transmit any personal data.  It does not utilize internet connection for any functionality.

            All files are stored exclusively on your device.
        </p>

        <h3> What Device Settings/Features Does FieldConcepts Look Detect? </h3>
        <p>
            FieldConcepts only looks at two device preferences/states:
            <br>
            (1) Your device’s appearance mode (light mode or dark mode).  This is for allowing FieldConcepts to automatically adjust its appearance to match your device preference.
            <br>
            (2) FieldConcepts may attempt to access your Clipboard in order to paste an overlay image for tracing.  It will only do this when you explicitly tap "Paste Trace Image".
        </p>

        <h3> Contact </h3>

            For any concerns, questions, or inquires, feel free to reach out.
