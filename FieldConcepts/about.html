        <h3> Welcome to FieldConcepts! </h3>
        <p>
            FieldConcepts is an app for conceptualizing and designing marching band field shows.
        </p>

        <h3> Creating a Show </h3>
        <p>
            You can create a new show by tapping the plus button in the right hand corner.  Shows can be tagged and grouped in folders.
        </p>

        <h3> Selection Mode </h3>
        <p>
			Here you can lasso select one or more dots to move, rotate, scale, and apply other transformations.
			<br><br>
			Press the Selection Mode button again to change the lasso shape.
			<br><br>
			If you don’t have an Apple Pencil, you can press and hold on the canvas to start a selection.
        </p>

        <h3> Add dots </h3>
        <p>
			Here, you can create new “dots” for your performers. You can do this one at a time or by using one of the three shape tools.
			<br><br>
			You can also pick the instrument dot group for which the new dots should be assigned.
        </p>

		<h3> Page Selector </h3>
        <p>
			By tapping the sidebar icon on the left side of the toolbar, you can show the left sidebar.
			<br><br>
			The first tab on the sidebar is the Page Selector. This is where you can create new pages, clone existing pages, add measure numbers and notes to a drill page, and pick the page to load on the canvas.
        </p>

		<h3> Dot Groups </h3>
		<p>
			The second tab on the left sidebar is for your Dot Groups.
			<br><br>
			Dot Groups allow you to categorize your performers based on instrument. There also custom dot groups which allow you to group any set of dots based on any criteria you need. For example, you can create a custom dot group of all soloists to easily select them at any time.
