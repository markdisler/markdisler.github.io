						<i>“My Macbook Pro hadn't been functioning properly for quite some time and Apple told me I had to go to a 3rd party store to fix my laptop since it is a model from 2011 (and obviously they want me to purchase a newer model vs helping me fix my "vintage one" as they called it). I was gonna just buy a new laptop but I decided first to try and find reliable repair shop to see if I could get my laptop working again. So glad I found My Computer Tech Inc. The man who helped me [...]  was friendly and he got my laptop working perfectly again! So glad I found this place :)”</i>

						It took no time and they were so kind about it-- explaining the problem to me.

						Will highly recommend to friends.”</i>

						<i> "Ofir bought the store from the old owner, old owner is a family friend. Ofir is young, smart, honest, and very competent. Super-good dude. I went in thinking I might need to get a new hard-drive and Ofir said, No, you don't need that, you need a new battery. He's honest and smart and that's a great combo. He also does phone and tablet repairs, that's somewhat new. Very satisfied customer"</i>

						<i>"I recently had an issue with my desktop shutting down and crashing and although I have some experience with PC's I couldnt diagnose the specific issue. I brought my PC to My Computer Tech and my first thought walking in the door was how clean and organized the place was. 

						They were extremely professional and very courteous.They offered a free diagnostic and Avi called me within 2 hours letting me know the problem is that my CPU cooler had died (i had suspected that but was unsure). He quoted me a fair price not only fixed that issue but installed some other hardware I had been wanting to install for years but never had the time. The work was done quickly and professionally. Thanks to them my PC is running as smooth as ever. 

						I normally dont write Google reviews but after experiencing their excellent service I felt compelled to write a review. 

						Good Job guys !!!! Thank you !!!!"</i>

Thought I issue with my SSD boot drive and as it turns out, thanks to the guys there was no issue - only an issue with the adapter I was using. They didn't charge me anything and let me use one of their adapters to ensure nothing was wrong with my SSD. Salute to them for their great customer service!"</i>

My computer runs fast with no glitches. Always a pleasant experience. Highly recommended."</i>
